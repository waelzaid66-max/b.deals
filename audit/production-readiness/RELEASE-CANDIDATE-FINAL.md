# Release Candidate — Final (Release Freeze)

**Date:** 2026-07-08  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Mode:** **RELEASE FREEZE** — no new features; Critical/High only if proven.

---

## Decision

| Environment | Verdict | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Code base / CI design** | **GO WITH FIXES** | Freeze fixes applied; full TypeScript + lint pass |
| **Staging** | **GO WHEN OPS BLOCKERS CLOSED** | Authenticated smoke + DB reachability still blocked by runtime secrets/network |
| **Global production (stores)** | **NO-GO** | App-store operational gates (EAS signing/device/store checks) not fully completed |

**Overall:** **NO-GO** for immediate global publish under strict final criteria.

---

## What completed (this freeze wave)

- Open-items backlog extracted and closed for all **DOCS/CODE** items reachable without secrets
- PHASE reports 02–20 written (inspection; no feature work)
- Marketplace sections readiness documented
- `.gitignore` noise cleanup
- `STAGING-REQUIRED-SECRETS.md` exact inventory (no fake values)
- Produce proof: mobile tests path clarification; DB/API health code confirmed intact
- Multi-cloud: Replit + AWS + GCP **retained**

## What remains (OPS / policy — not unfinished product code)

| # | Item | Owner |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Staging API URL + Clerk JWTs → `staging-p0-smoke.mjs` | Operator |
| 2 | `DATABASE_URL` → `verify-upload-claims-schema.mjs` | Operator |
| 3 | Device listing publish smoke | Operator |
| 4 | EAS login + preview/production builds + signing | Operator |
| 5 | Confirm Actions green in browser/`gh` | Operator |
| 6 | `ERROR_ALERT_WEBHOOK` live test (recommended) | Operator |
| 7 | Apple/Google Sign-In / push provider config | Operator |
| 8 | Paymob enable | Policy SKIP until B5 |
| 9 | Consumer website build | Deferred SKIP |

---

## Risks remaining

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Staging never run | High for launch | Wave A secrets |
| `ensureSchemaPatches` fails on target DB | High for media | Verify script |
| Store build without `EXPO_PUBLIC_ROUTER_ORIGIN` | Medium | Checklist |
| No DR drill | Medium ops | DISASTER-RECOVERY-VERIFICATION |

---

## Release Freeze rules

1. No features / no cosmetic refactors  
2. Fix only Critical/High regressions with proof  
3. Minimal typecheck/tests for touched packages only  
4. Full mono gate only after material multi-package change
